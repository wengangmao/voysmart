##  1, Objectives of our research activities
- Develop models to estimate a ship's fuel consumption and maneuverability
- Develop models to describe the spatio-temporal correlation of metocean conditions encountered by ships
- Develop optimization algorithms to plan a ship's voyage with reduced fuel/emissions and enhanced safety & ETA
- Develop innovative measures to increase ship energy efficiency
- Develop control algorithms to automatically navigate a ship

## 2, Planning of staff/PhD milestones

* Daiyong Lic plan: 2022-09-30
* Martin Lic plan: 2022-09-30
* Xiao's PhD defense plan: 2022-12-30 
* New PhD student expected 2022-03-01
