+++

## Project background
E-NAV will develop a sail plan service and online training platform for the shipping industry. From real time data feeds received from meteorological, coastal, sea state, vessel and Earth Observation data archived in Copernicus, E-NAV will compute and transmit optimised sail plans to fleet managers and navigators. It will reduce fuel consumption, minimise hull fatigue, sail time, and reduce CO2 emissions. E-NAV will also include a training module with online gamification tools to teach navigators.


## Our tasks at Chalmers
- **Update real-time ship performance models for performance monitoring**
- **Develop training materials for various E-navigation components**
- **Develop a gamification website for training in sailing at harsh seas**
